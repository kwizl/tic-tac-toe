- Enter into the project folder `cd tic-tac-toe`
- To start the game, run this command `./bin/main.rb`

## How To Play The Game
  We've made the game quite as interactive as possible, however for now, only one person can control inputing the choices of the two players.
  ### Rules
  ### Win Scenerios
  - To win this game, a player should try to be the first to align himself/herself three-times consecutively on a straightline; either **vertically**, **horrizontally** or **diagonally** and at the same time always try to prevent his/her opponent from achieving same first.

  E.g A case of **Diagonal** WIN

  ### stalemate
  - If none of the players is able to occupy 3 consecutive slots before the 9 slots are exhausted, no player wins the round.

  ### Do's && Dont's
  - At the start of the game, it prompts both players to input their names, however if no names are given, the system automatically assigns names(Player 1 or Player 2) to them.
  - A player is allowed to input Numerical values from **1 to 9 only** to occupy a slot on the game board

  - A player cannot choose a slot that has previously been chosen by them or the other player
